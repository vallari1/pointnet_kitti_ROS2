[33mCMake Warning (dev) at /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/pcl/PCLConfig.cmake:146 (find_package):
  Policy CMP0144 is not set: find_package uses upper-case <PACKAGENAME>_ROOT
  variables.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0144" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  CMake variable EIGEN_ROOT is set to:

  For compatibility, find_package is ignoring the variable, but code in a
  .cmake module might still use it.
